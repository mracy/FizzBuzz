# FizzBuzz Java Program

This is a Java program that implements the "FizzBuzz" algorithm. The program reads an integer `n` from the console and prints the numbers from `1` to `n`, following the FizzBuzz rules:

- If a number is divisible by `3`, it prints "Fizz".
- If a number is divisible by `5`, it prints "Buzz".
- If a number is divisible by both `3` and `5`, it prints "FizzBuzz".
- If none of these conditions are met, it prints the number itself.

## How to Run the Program

1. Clone the repository or download the program files.
2. Compile the Java program using a Java compiler:
    ```
    javac Solution.java
    ```
3. Run the program from the command line:
    ```
    java Solution
    ```
4. The program will prompt you to enter an integer (`n`). Type in an integer and press Enter.
5. The program will then print the FizzBuzz sequence from `1` to `n` according to the rules described above.

## Expected Output

The output of the program will vary depending on the integer input (`n`). For each number from `1` to `n`, the program will print one of the following:

- "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both `3` and `5`.
- "Fizz" if the number is divisible by `3` but not `5`.
- "Buzz" if the number is divisible by `5` but not `3`.
- The number itself if it is not divisible by either `3` or `5`.

## Example

Here's an example of the program's output if the input number is `15`:
